# Spotify AOTY User Ratings Injector

This Tampermonkey script injects user ratings from Album of The Year (AOTY) into Spotify album pages. The script automatically fetches ratings for tracks in an album and displays them alongside the track titles. It also includes the total rating for the album itself next to the album title.


## Features

- Automatic Ratings Injection: Displays AOTY user ratings on Spotify album pages.
- Dynamic Content Handling: Works with dynamically loaded Spotify content.
- Custom CSS: Provides visually appealing rating badges with gradient colors based on scores.
- Fallbacks: Handles missing ratings gracefully by displaying placeholders or 'N/A.'

## Usage
Navigate to any album page on Spotify (e.g., https://open.spotify.com/album/...).
Wait a moment for the ratings to load next to each track.
Check the console for additional information and debugging.
